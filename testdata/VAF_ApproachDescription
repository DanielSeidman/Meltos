VAF CRP Count Appraoches

Approach1 (incorrect):

Count all concordant reads in interval, divide # by 2 and subtract discordant counts provided by Tardis

Approach 2 (potentially incorrect):

Due to small SVs, extend each SV one read length in each direction and count all reads in region

Approach 3 (current solution):

Count all concordant reads in interval, remove reads in same pair that are counted twice

Approach 4

Manually inspected SVs

approach 7

somatic - ones that overlap with somatic grocsv
germline - one that overlap with germline grocsv
